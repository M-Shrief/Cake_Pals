Calculate different distances from a relative point by kilometers:

using [calculator](https://www.calculator.net/distance-calculator.html)if we
started from x = [-73.856077,40.848447], then:

- from x to [-73.8786113,40.8502883] = 1.91 km
- from x to [-73.839297,40.78147] = 7.57 km
- from x to [-73.8803827,40.7643124] = 9.57 km
- from x to [-73.8601152,40.7311739] = 13.03 km
- from x to [-73.961704,40.662942] = 22.45 km
- from x to [-73.98241999999999,40.579505] = 31.72 km
